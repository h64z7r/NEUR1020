NEUR1020   Research   Claim   Essay
How   do we ensure that we   remember   important   information—like the content   covered   in   a psychology course? Careful study   is a   key   ingredient to   successful   recall,   but   what   is   the   most efficient way to study?   Research on the so-called testing   effect   has   shown   that   recall   is   superior   when study   involves testing one’s   memory for the   material   rather than   simply   reviewing   it.   Refining   your own study   practices   by   incorporating   periodical testing of your   memory   is a straightforward   way to   improve your   learning!
For the   Research Claim   Essay, we want you to   present and   defend   a thesis   statement that   is   supported   by evidence drawn from two scientific journal articles   (details   provided   below). The articles   both focus on the testing effect. Guidance   on   how to   structure   and   write the   research   claim   essay will   be   provided   in tutorials.
The evidence supporting your thesis statement   must   be sourced   from   the   following   two   articles:
Karpicke,J.   D.    Roediger,   H.   L.   (2008). The critical   importance of   retrieval for   learning. Science, 319,   966-968.http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1152408
Note:   You   will need to look through   the supplementary materials   for this article,   which   are   included in   the PDF available on   Blackboard.

代做程序编程语言rg/10.1177/0098628315573144You will   have to   develop your own thesis statement   based on the   information   provided   in   these two      research articles. The evidence from each of the two   articles   must   independently   support   your   thesis   statement   in   its entirety   (i.e., the evidence from   each article should   support   all   aspects   of   your   thesis   statement,   not just   part of it). You   may cite additional   research   papers   as   background to   introduce the topic,   but the evidence supporting your thesis statement   must   come from   the   two   articles   mentioned above. We are not   looking for   a   review   of the   overall   balance   of   evidence,   nor   are we   looking for a discussion of points   both for   and   against   the thesis   statement.
Your essay will   be   marked   by the course tutors. All   marking will   follow   the   Marking   Criteria   that   you   can find on   Blackboard via the Assessment tab,   in the   Research Claim   Essay   section.
The word limit for the   Research Claim   Essay is   1500   words   (+10%   leeway).   We   require   that   you   include a statement detailing the   extent to which   you   relied   on   AI   tools   when   producing   your   essay.   You should acknowledge whether AI tools were   used to   assist   in   planning,   drafting,   proofreading,   and/or   refining your essay text   by   including a Transparency Statement   on the   use   of AI Tools. This   statement does   not contribute towards the word limit.
